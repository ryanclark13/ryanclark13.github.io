      The Honey Badger, also known as the ratel, is a fierce little animal. It is native to Africa, Sounthwest Asia, and the Indian Subcontinent. It is a primarily carnivorous species and are related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers. People would think their favorite food is honey, hence their name, but really what they love to eat is the bee larvae found in the honey.</p>

      <div class="col s12 flow-text">

      <p>They do not have many predators because of its thick skin and defensive abilities. It has a flat body and strong legs. Its hair is thick and black with white stripes across its back. It looks similar to a skunk and also has a gland at the base of its tail that stores a stinky liquid. If it's frightened it will release this liquid, or just to mark its territory.</p>

      <p>You can say thay these creatures are lazy in some sort of way, becuase when it comes down to housing they don't care. They have been found in dens of aardvarks, foxes, mongooses, and springhares. On top of that they are also mean little animals! They are in the Guiness Book Of World Records and the "Worlds most fearless Creature". Their only enemies include hyenas, lions, leopards, and pythons.</p>
